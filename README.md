# Ray Tracing in Rust
Originally based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), now mostly a place to experiment with ideas about performance and new features.

# Future work
- Work on GPU support
- Add support for triangles
  - More generally add support for more 3D objects
- Make it more efficient
